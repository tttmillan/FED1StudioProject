                    Basic information about how to manage a person's finances. Budgeting, saving, and tips to control spending are included in the beginners group. We all have to start somewhere. The easiest way to start is to use only cash. That way a person can see where every dollar is spent. If a person runs out of cash, then they can not buy anything else.

This is more about how to break down spending per week and using the envelope method to build up envelopes to have a emergency fund and how to stay on track.

                    This is when a person already has knowledge on how to manage their finances. This includes being able to manipulate the use of credit cards by paying off their balance each month and receiving the rewards offered with the card. In addition, this person knows how to invest in tangible items when good deals present themselves. As an expert, this person is able to share things they have learned along the way to help others and research how to stay up to date on best practices on finances.
