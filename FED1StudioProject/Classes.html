                    Basic information about how to manage a person's finances. Budgeting, saving, and tips to control spending are included in the beginners group. We all have to start somewhere. The easiest way to start is to use only cash. That way a person can see where every dollar is spent. If a person runs out of cash, then they can not buy anything else.
