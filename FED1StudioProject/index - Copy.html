                        We are a Company that has been around for over twenty years. We started as a financial group that started with helping with retirement and came to realize that many people did not have the fundamentals really understood. So we started this school to help people become more knowledgeable about finances.

                        We are not judgmental or bias. We understand that sometimes we need a refresher of things we already know, or were not taught from school/parents because talking about money was not as common as it is today.

                        Everyone has different levels of financial knowledge. With that in mind when you meet with our staff they will guide you into where to begin. A person does not have to start in the very beginning. A person can start anywhere they want or just take certain classes.
